# Winuxsh

[中文](README-zh.md) · English

> **bash for Windows — no WSL, no MSYS2, no PowerShell surprises.**
> Built for humans and coding agents, tested against the bash spec.

```text
me@DESKTOP C:\Users\me\repo\winuxsh  master ●2 ✚1 ?3
❯
```

Branch name, dirty state, staged/untracked counts — all built into the prompt
the moment you `cd` into a git repo.  No plugins to install.  No config to
tweak.  Just `❯` and go.

## Why

You know how PowerShell does `ls` and gives you a table of objects?  Or how
`test -f Cargo.toml` doesn't exist in pwsh?  Or how your coding agent keeps
failing because the shell it expected isn't there?

Winuxsh fixes that.  It is the terminal that feels like bash, lives on
Windows like PowerShell, and speaks Windows-native paths (`C:\Users`, not
`/mnt/c/Users`).

```bash
# That works — immediately, from the first keystroke
cd C:\Users\me\Documents
ls -la
git status
if [ -d repo ]; then echo "found it"; fi
```

## Quick start

```pwsh
cargo build --release
target\release\winuxsh.exe
```

The first time you start it, you get a setup wizard (think `oh-my-zsh` install):

```text
🎉  Welcome to Winuxsh 0.6.0!
✨  A bash-compatible shell for Windows — no WSL, no MSYS2 required.

  Let's get you set up.  (Press Enter to accept defaults.)

📝  Editing mode
  │  emacs = standard keybindings (Ctrl+A/E/K, Tab, Ctrl+R)
  │  vi    = vim-style insert/normal modes
  │  Enter choice [emacs/vi]:

🎨  Colour theme
  │  Enter choice [default/dark/light/colorful]:

🎵  Prompt symbol
  │  ❯ heavy right-pointing angle (powerlevel10k style)
  │  λ lambda (functional/minimal)
  │  $ dollar sign (classic bash)
  │  % percent sign (classic fish)
  │  Enter choice [❯/λ/$/%]:

⏱️  Right-side info
  │  off  = no right prompt
  │  time = show current time (HH:MM)
  │  full = time + git branch
  │  Enter choice [off/time/full]:

🔄  Show git branch/status in the prompt [Y/n]:
```

That is it.  One round of questions, `~/.winshrc.toml` is written, and
every launch after that is instant.

## What makes it different

| You want this                  | PowerShell gives you       | Winuxsh gives you          |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| `ls` / `grep` / `find` / `cp`  | Aliases + cmdlets          | Real `winuxcmd` coreutils |
| `if [ -f file ]; then`         | `if (Test-Path file) {`    | Real bash `if`            |
| `for i in a b c; do ... done`  | `foreach ($i in ...) {`    | Real bash `for`           |
| `git:(master) ●2 ✚1` in prompt | Have to install oh-my-posh | Built in, works on `cd`   |
| `gst` / `gco` / `gp` (git)     | Custom aliases             | Pre-installed git aliases |
| `$(command)`                   | `$(command)` but different | Same as bash              |
| `exit 127`                     | `$LASTEXITCODE`            | Same as bash              |
| `C:\Users` paths               | Works natively             | Also works natively       |
| `Ctrl+R` history search        | Yes (but different)        | Yes (reedline, standard)  |
| `cd .. && pwd`                 | Yes                        | Yes                       |
| Setup wizard                   | No                         | Yes, oh-my-zsh style      |
| Coding agent friendly          | Not really                 | `-c` / `script.sh` quiet  |
| Reads your `.zshrc`            | No                         | `--zsh-compat-report`     |

## Screenshots

**A real terminal session** — `cd`, `ls`, `git status`, block completion:

```text
me@DESKTOP C:\Users\me\repo\winuxsh
❯ ls
Cargo.toml  src/  crates/  DOCS/  tests/  README.md

me@DESKTOP C:\Users\me\repo\winuxsh  master ●2 ✚1
❯ git status
Changes to be committed:
  modified:   src/shell.rs

me@DESKTOP C:\Users\me\repo\winuxsh  master ●2
❯ if [ -f Cargo.toml ]; then
  echo "yes, it is a rust project"
fi
yes, it is a rust project
```

**Autosuggestions** — ghost text after the cursor, accept with `Ctrl+Space`:

```text
me@DESKTOP C:\Users\me\repo\winuxsh  master
❯ cd rep○  ← "cd repo/" shows as hint
```

**Syntax highlighting** — commands in green, flags in cyan, errors in red.

**Right prompt** — time, git branch, or both:

```text
me@DESKTOP C:\Users\me\repo\winuxsh     09:47
❯
```

## What it runs

```
winuxsh = rubash (shell engine) + winuxcmd.exe (coreutils) + reedline (REPL)
```

| Component | Job |
|-----------|-----|
| `rubash`  | bash-compatible parser, executor, builtins, functions, heredocs |
| `winuxcmd`| Unix coreutils (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, ...) |
| `reedline`| Interactive editing, history, Tab completion, autosuggestions |
| `~/.winshrc.toml` | Configuration — prompt, theme, editor, aliases, more |
| `.zshrc` scan | `--zsh-compat-report` reads your zsh intent → native TOML |

## For zsh / Oh My Zsh users

You don't need to migrate manually.  Winuxsh can inspect your existing setup
and propose a safe import:

```pwsh
winuxsh --zsh-compat-report         # see what is importable
winuxsh --zsh-compat-import-plan    # preview the TOML it would write
winuxsh --zsh-compat-import-apply   # write it (with backup)
winuxsh --zsh-compat-doctor         # overall health check
```

Things that get imported from `.zshrc`:
- `PATH` / `ENV` exports (safe subset — no expansion or backtick)
- `alias` declarations
- `PROMPT` / `RPROMPT` (translated to native TOML template)
- Oh My Zsh plugin intent (e.g. `git` → native git alias pack)

What stays in `.zshrc` and continues working there:
- Complex `compdef` / `_arguments` (native completion reads the same files)
- Custom functions (winuxsh reads the same function source via rubash)
- Theme expressions that can't be translated (`%F{...}` parsing)

## Built-in git aliases

These work out of the box, no config required:

```text
gst → git status         gco → git checkout         gp → git push
gl  → git pull           gd  → git diff              ga → git add
gc  → git commit -v      gb  → git branch            gr → git remote
gsta → git stash save    gstp → git stash pop         glg → git log --stat
```

Full list: about 40 aliases mirroring oh-my-zsh git plugin.
User `[aliases]` in `~/.winshrc.toml` override any built-in.

## Configuration reference

Minimal `~/.winshrc.toml`:

```toml
[shell]
prompt_format = "{user}@{host} {cwd} {git_prompt}{symbol}"
prompt_symbol = "❯"
right_prompt_format = "{time} "

[editor]
edit_mode = "emacs"           # emacs | vi

[theme]
current_theme = "default"     # default | dark | light | colorful | custom

[aliases]
ll = "ls -la"

[completions]
matching = "prefix"           # prefix | substring
case_sensitive = false
```
